# LyMythical IPA Signer

A lightweight, proof-of-concept IPA signing web interface — fully developed and deployed **entirely on a non-jailbroken iPhone**.

This repository showcases the possibility of creating and running a basic IPA signing service using only on-device tools, without the need for a macOS system, PC, or jailbreak. The project is a testament to the flexibility of modern cloud-based development platforms and mobile-first workflows.

**Disclaimer:** This tool is created for educational and experimental purposes only. It is not intended for production use or for signing applications for distribution via the App Store.

**Key Features:**
- Simple web UI for uploading `.ipa`, `.p12`, and `.mobileprovision` files
- Runs on Flask backend
- Portable, minimal setup
- Designed entirely on iPhone (no computer involved)

Made with determination — and an iPhone.
